# Easy-Itinerary

Easy Itinerary is a web application that helps users search for user created travel itineraries by country. The application consists of a backend built using Fastify and a frontend built using React, enabling users to explore travel itineraries by country and get specific details for each itinerary. 
<br/>
<br/>
The database features three tables: users, countries, and itineraries. Each itinerary in the itineraries table is linked to a user via the users_id foreign key and to a country via the country_id foreign key. 

## Current Features âœ¨
- Country search with dynamic filtering
